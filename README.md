# iupload

You'll need to install Node.js and `graphicsmagick` on your OS in order for the website to run

To run the website, you'll need to compile the webpack assets and run `index.js`. If you want to deploy the website, check out an utility called pm2, but running it with `node` is sufficient for testing and development.

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
node index.js
```
